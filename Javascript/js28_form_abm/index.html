        Summary
        The man-apes of Africa were perpetually starving, the victims of drought and lack of food. At
        dawn, Moon-Watcher noticed that his father had died, took the corpse out of the cave and
        continued about his business. Later he foraged for berries and other edible plants with two of
        his compatriots from other caves. Moon-Watch was one of the largest of his group and the only
        one able to walk upright. The tribe often went without food. As they gathered berries, the manapes were unaware of the potential source of nourishment in the antelope- like creatures that
        ate beside them.
        Moon-Watcher awoke late that night, to the sound of a large beast dragging a carcass. Then, he
        heard an unidentifiable sound, that had never before existed in the world—metal clanging
        against stone. As Moon-Watcher's tribe headed to the river, he first encountered the New Rock.
        After glaring at it, Moon- Watcher licked it, discovered it was of no nutritional value, and
        continued on. As the tribe approached the Rock on its way back from an unsuccessful day of
        foraging, a foreign sound, a repetitive vibration, began. As the sound increased in volume, the
        man-apes were drawn closer to the Rock; they stood in front of it, totally hypnotized. Unknown
        to the man-apes, their minds were being studied, their bodies probed, and their actions
        controlled.
        One entranced man-ape picked up a piece of grass, tried and failed to tie a knot. Then another
        man-ape tried and another, until a young man-ape tied the first knot ever on Earth. When
        Moon-Watcher was possessed, he picked up stones, trying to throw them at a bulls-eye on the
        monolith. An intense pleasure overcame him when, after many attempts, he finally succeeded.
        As the days went on, the monolith ignored most of the man-apes, but continued to interact with
        some of them, including Moon-Watcher. His mind was being developed, even though his
        instincts made him want to break free of the monolith. One day as a group of pigs came across
        his tribe, Moon-Watcher experienced an entirely new set of impulses. He looked around for a
        rock, picked it up and ran toward a pig, and killed it. The man-apes learned to feast on the dead
        pig—their hunger problem was solved.
        The man-apes were taught to use many other tools and soon enough the tools became a part of
        their everyday lives. With near-starvation no longer a pressing concern, the man-apes first
        experience leisure and the evolutionary predecessor of thought. One day, Moon-Watcher's tribe
        came across a dead animal. As dusk was nearing, it was not safe for the man-apes to be out with
        the carcass. It dawned on Moon-Watch that he could drag the animal back to his cave. He began
        to do so, sometimes aided, sometimes hindered by the other members of his tribe, who could
        barely understand what he was doing.
        Still, a giant and fearful leopard haunted the tribe. One evening, in came into Moon-Watcher's
        cave. He began to attack it with some of the tools they had developed for hunting. His fellow
        tribesman joined in and the leopard ran from the cave, disappearing over a precipice, and
        plunging to its death. The tribe found the dead leopard the following day. They cut off the head
        and carried it about with them. They displayed this to a rival tribe, which cowered in fear.
        Moon-Watcher began to understand that he need no longer feared the leopard, "now he was
        master of his world."
        The 100,000 years since the monolith visited earth saw no new inventions among the man-apes,
        but they were refining their tools and learning to use them better. Their teeth became smaller as
        they further relied on tools; consequently, their jaw became more refined-the first step toward
        speech. Ice ages came and went and the descendents of the man-apes further developed their
        physical and mental abilities. At the end of this long process was man. The first men had no
        more advanced tools than the man apes, but they had speech and were able to share knowledge
        and pass it to the next generations. They began to develop more powerful tools and materials.
        He invented writing, philosophy, and religion. His weapons increased in scope-spears gave way
        to guns, which gave ways to guided missiles and nuclear warheads. These weapons had helped
        man conquer the world, but "as long as they existed, he was living on borrowed time."
        Analysis
        The book begins by describing creatures, "man-apes," who are the biological predecessors of
        humans. The narrator is omniscient, capable of describing the internal mental states of these
        creatures in ways they would not think. For instance, at the start of the book we are told that
        Moon-Watcher feels "a dim disquiet that was the ancestor of sadness." This type of talk is
        strange and unsettling to most people. We are not used to confronting the fact that we were
        evolved from "lower" beings in this way. By taking this perspective on the man- apes, the
        narrator jars us, putting people, including the reader, in their proper evolutionary framework.
        Humans are conceives as intimately related to the man-apes. The opening of the book
        implicitly connects us back with beings whom we would most likely consider animals.
        The activities by the monolith offer a particularly interesting bit of science fiction, while
        raising many questions. The intelligent beings who begin to control the man-apes teach them to
        do various things, like tying knots and hunting. Still, not all man-apes can be taught—only
        certain ones are capable of learning, of being improved. This whole incident presents a new
        take on evolution, one in which an external entity intervenes to push forward human evolution.
        At the same time, this process retains many of the features of evolution—the man-apes are not
        extended beyond their natural limitations—nothing supernatural is occurring; they simply learn
        to use their natural endowment in new ways.
        This whole episode raises a very interesting, counterfactual question. At this point in the book,
        the man-apes are starving. We wonder if they would have learned to hunt if the monolith never
        descended and the man-apes were never taught to hunt. Furthermore, the narrator expands on
        the significance to the man-apes of learning to hunt. Since they could hunt, they were no longer
        constantly concerned with the origin of their next meal and they had time for leisure and "the
        first rudiments of thought." If the man apes had never been taught by the monolith to hunt,
        would these behaviors have ever developed? Would humans have ever evolved or would the
        man apes have simply died out or produced a much less impressive evolutionary line?
        At the end of part one the narrator comments, "as long as [nuclear weapons] existed, [man] was
        living on borrowed time." This foreboding sentence serves a number of purposes. First, it
        introduces to the narrative the notion that technology could pose a problem for people,
        foreshadowing the later developments of the book, in which technology gets beyond human
        control. Second, this statement begins to develop one of the major themes of the book-the
        potential destructive power of technology. While this point has become trite in contemporary
        society, there was a strong attitude, prevalent in the decade before 2001 was written, that
        developing technology would lead inexorably toward human progress.
        Part Two (Chapters 7–14)
        Summary
        Though Dr. Heywood Floyd had been to Mars once and the Moon three times, he had never
        gotten over the excitement of space travel. As Dr. Floyd headed to his Florida launch location
        after a meeting with the president, he was bombarded with questions from reporters. He gave a
        quick "no comment," not willing to confirm nor deny a reporter's suspicion that an epidemic
        had broken out on the moon. Floyd boards his private flight to Space Station One and enjoyed
        the unnaturally high acceleration of takeoff.
        Floyd watched the space station adjust to receive his incoming vessel and was greeted by Nick
        Miller of station security soon after the shuttle had fully docked. Floyd was brought to a lounge
        area to wait a half-hour before his flight to the moon. The Space Station was jointly operated by
        the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., so it was no surprise when, after calling home to leave a message for
        his secretary, Floyd was approached by his friend Dr. Dimitri Moisevitch of the U.S.S.R.
        academy of Science. Moisevitch asked Floyd about the Quarantine in the U.S. sector of the
        moon. He wanted to know about the epidemic. Floyd insisted that he couldn't say anything.
        Finally, Moisevitch asked if he knew anything about TMA-1. Floyd feigned ignorance and was
        soon boarding his flight to the Moon.
        On the trip over, Floyd caught up on world news, using his Newspad, before being entertained
        by the Balinese stewardess and, finally, heading to sleep. When Floyd awoke, they were nearing
        the moon. He noticed that the Earth, "a giant moon to the moon," was filling the moon with
        light. A crater filled his field of vision as the spaceship descended. After a routine flight, Dr.
        Floyd arrived on the moon.
        Clavius, one of the moon's largest craters, was home to a base on the moon that could
        independently support human life. Many of the technologies developed during the cold war had
        been harnessed to create this technologically advanced environment. When Floyd reaches the
        Base, he is greeted by Ralph Halvorson, the man who oversees this area of the moon. They
        defer heading immediately to the briefing room in order to chat in his office. Halvorson
        explains that the moon dwellers are troubled by the secrecy surrounding TMA-1. They then
        head off to the briefing, Floyd eager to find out more about TMA-1.
        Floyd conveys the president's thanks to the staff for their hard work and emphasizes the
        importance of secrecy until the facts are ascertained. Dr. Michaels begins his demonstration,
        showing a picture of Tycho, another moon crater. He then explains that in conducting a
        magnetic survey of the area, they discovered a disturbance there, Tycho Magnetic Anomoly
        One (TMA-1). A team of excavators was sent to the area and eventually unearthed a large,
        smoothly cut, black slab. At first, Michaels explains, it was thought that this might be related to
        the Chinese. But, he continues, they have now learned that this slab predates humans. It is three
        million years old and the first known sign of intelligent life.
        Floyd joins a team driving across the moon in a mobile lab to TMA-1. Along the ride, he,
        Michaels and Halvorson speculate about the origin and nature of the big black slab. The slab
        had been a complete enigma and no one had been able to get inside of it. Surely, Floyd thought,
        those who left the slab could not have come from the earth or moon—other signs of this
        intelligent life would have been left behind. They arrived at the site and Dr. Floyd donned a
        space suit in order to get a closer look at the slab. After pausing for a photograph, Floyd
        watches the sun rise across the horizon as the slab is exposed to light for the first time in three
        million years. He and the rest of the crew are suddenly overcome by a loud and piercing noise.
        Deep Space Monitor seventy-nine, 100 million miles from Earth, detected and sent to earth a
        panoply of information about the solar system. It had now recorded an unnatural disturbance
        that would be communicated back to Earth. When the Radiation Forecaster back on Earth saw
        this disturbance, he examined it more closely and discovered an energy pattern, racing away
        from the moon, headed out toward the far reaches of the Universe.
        Analysis
        In these chapters, we are introduced to many of the technologies of the book. Details of the
        food and drink in space, as well as the specially designed bathroom are presented. When we get
        to Clavius Base, Clarke is sure to describe the intricate details of the technological amenities he
        imagines necessary to sustain life in space. Perhaps most notable among the technologies in
        this section is the Newspad. This is the machine that Floyd uses to read news from the different
        electronic newspapers. It is amazing how much this technology resembles the technologies of
        the Internet and hand-held computers or personal digital assistants. It is quite remarkable that
        Clarke would have dreamed this up way back in the 1960s.
        Even more remarkable than his imagination of the Newspad, however, is the following
        description Clarke offers of the world Floyd inhabits: "even if one read only the English
        versions (of the newspapers), one could spend an entire lifetime doing nothing but absorbing
        the ever changing flow of information from the news satellites." In the 1960s, the American
        economy was still very much focused on industrial production. The "information age" that
        began in the 1990s was still decades away. In this passage, Clarke anticipates the glut of
        information that has come to be a reality in the actual world in 2001.
        As Floyd nears the moon, the narrator describes how the moon grows beneath him, eventually
        filling his entire field of vision. The Earth is described as "a moon to the moon," lighting parts
        of the moon with light reflected form the sun. These descriptions invert the order of things as
        we are used to it. The Moon is presented as being like the Earth, and the Earth as like the Moon.
        This is only one instance of the many facets of space-travel that are so radically new. This
        description, as well as many others throughout the book, helps the reader to expand his
        horizons and see the world from an entirely different perspective. This is key in a novel like
        this, which, in order to achieve its full effect, requires the reader's ability to push his
        imagination to its limits.
        As Floyd is beginning to examine the slab, he is stopped so that someone can photograph him.
        He finds this a bit odd, but is happy to have the pictures. This scene conveys the increasing
        tendency of man to record everything as it happens, to focus as much on the recording of events
        as on the events themselves.
